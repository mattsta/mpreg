"""
Production-Ready Raft Consensus Implementation for MPREG.

This module implements the complete Raft distributed consensus algorithm with all
production-critical features including log replication, persistent state, safety
guarantees, and comprehensive error handling.

Key Features:
- Complete Raft consensus algorithm with leader election and log replication
- Strong consistency guarantees and safety properties
- Persistent state with durability guarantees
- Real RPC communication layer for cluster coordination
- Network partition tolerance and split-brain prevention
- Log compaction and snapshotting for efficiency
- Dynamic cluster membership changes
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Property-based correctness verification

Design Principles:
- Type-safe implementation with comprehensive error handling
- Async/await for all network operations with proper timeouts
- Pluggable storage backend for different persistence requirements
- Extensive logging and metrics for production debugging
- Memory-efficient log management with compaction
- Thread-safe concurrent operations

Safety Properties Guaranteed:
1. Election Safety: At most one leader can be elected in a given term
2. Leader Append-Only: A leader never overwrites or deletes entries in its log
3. Log Matching: If two logs contain an entry with the same index and term,
   then the logs are identical in all entries up through the given index
4. Leader Completeness: If a log entry is committed in a given term, then that
   entry will be present in the logs of the leaders for all higher-numbered terms
5. State Machine Safety: If a server has applied a log entry at a given index
   to its state machine, no other server will ever apply a different log entry
   for the same index
