# Federated Multi-Cluster RPC Implementation

**STATUS: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATIONAL**

## Executive Summary

The **Federated Multi-Cluster RPC system** has been successfully implemented by **integrating federated propagation capabilities into MPREG's existing infrastructure** rather than building a separate system. This approach leverages MPREG's mature message bus, connection management, and serialization systems while adding multi-hop announcement propagation.

## Key Architectural Decision: Integration Over Separation

Instead of building a separate federated RPC system (as originally designed), we discovered that MPREG already had robust function broadcasting infrastructure via:

- **`_broadcast_new_function`**: Existing function announcement system
- **`RPCServerHello`**: Mature message format for function announcements
- **`peer_connections`**: Established connection management
- **Topic message bus and pub/sub**: Complete messaging infrastructure

The federated capabilities were **integrated into these existing systems** rather than duplicated.

## Current Implementation Architecture

### 1. Type-Safe Federated Data Structures

**Location**: `mpreg/datastructures/federated_types.py`

The system now uses strongly-typed dataclasses instead of primitive types:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class FederatedPropagationInfo:
    """Encapsulates federated RPC propagation metadata."""
    hop_count: HopCount  # type alias for int
    max_hops: MaxHops    # type alias for int
    announcement_id: AnnouncementID  # type alias for str
    original_source: NodeURL         # type alias for str

    @property
    def can_forward(self) -> bool:
        return self.hop_count < self.max_hops

    @property
    def is_initial_announcement(self) -> bool:
        return self.hop_count == 0

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class FederatedRPCAnnouncement:
    """Complete federated RPC announcement combining server capabilities and propagation info."""
    capabilities: ServerCapabilities
    propagation: FederatedPropagationInfo

    def should_process(self, local_node: NodeURL, tracker: FederatedAnnouncementTracker) -> bool:
        """Check if this announcement should be processed by the local node."""
        # For initial announcements (hop_count=0), allow the server to broadcast its own functions
        if self.propagation.is_initial_announcement:
            return (
                not tracker.has_seen(self.propagation.announcement_id)
                and self.propagation.can_forward
            )

        # For forwarded announcements, include loop detection
        return (
            not tracker.has_seen(self.propagation.announcement_id)
            and self.propagation.can_forward
            and not self.is_loop_back(local_node)
        )
```

### 2. Enhanced RPCServerHello Message Format

The existing `RPCServerHello` message was extended with federated propagation fields:

```python
class RPCServerHello(BaseModel):
    # Existing MPREG fields
    funs: tuple[str, ...] = Field(description="Functions provided by this server")
    locs: tuple[str, ...] = Field(description="Locations/resources associated with this server")
    cluster_id: str = Field(description="The ID of the cluster this server belongs to")
    advertised_urls: tuple[str, ...] = Field(default_factory=tuple)

    # NEW: Federated propagation fields (mpreg/core/model.py:116-120)
    hop_count: int = Field(default=0, description="Number of hops from original source")
    max_hops: int = Field(default=3, description="Maximum hops before dropping message")
    announcement_id: str = Field(default="", description="Unique ID for deduplication")
    original_source: str = Field(default="", description="Original server that announced the function")
```

### 3. Enhanced `_broadcast_new_function` Implementation

Location: **`mpreg/server.py:1766-1840`**

The existing function broadcasting was enhanced with federated multi-hop propagation:

```python
async def _broadcast_new_function(
    self, name: str, resources: Iterable[str], hop_count: int = 0,
    max_hops: int = 3, announcement_id: str = "", original_source: str = ""
) -> None:
    """Broadcast a newly registered function to all connected peers with federated propagation."""

    # Generate announcement ID for new announcements
    if hop_count == 0:
        announcement_id = f"{self.cluster.local_url}:{name}:{time.time()}"
        original_source = self.cluster.local_url

    # Deduplication check
    if announcement_id in self.cluster.seen_announcements:
        return

    # Hop limit enforcement
    if hop_count >= max_hops:
        return

    # Register as seen and broadcast to peers
    self.cluster.seen_announcements[announcement_id] = current_time

    # Create enhanced RPCServerHello with federated fields
    hello_message = RPCServerRequest(
        server=RPCServerHello(
            funs=(name,),
            locs=tuple(resources),
            cluster_id=self.cluster.cluster_id,
            advertised_urls=tuple(self.cluster.advertised_urls),
            hop_count=hop_count,
            max_hops=max_hops,
            announcement_id=announcement_id,
            original_source=original_source,
        ),
        u=str(ulid.new())
    )

    # Broadcast to all connected peers
    for peer_connection in self.cluster.peer_connections.values():
        await peer_connection.send(self.cluster.serializer.serialize(hello_message))
```

### 4. Federated Message Handling in `run_server`

Location: **`mpreg/server.py:1105-1125`**

The HELLO message handler was enhanced to support federated forwarding:

```python
# Process incoming HELLO messages with federated support
if req.server.what == "HELLO":
    for fun_name in req.server.funs:
        # Use original_source for federated announcements
        if req.server.hop_count > 0 and req.server.original_source:
            server_url = req.server.original_source
        else:
            server_url = req.server.advertised_urls[0] if req.server.advertised_urls else server_connection.url

        # Register function in local funtimes mapping
        self.funtimes[fun_name] = server_url

        # Forward to other peers if within hop limit
        if (req.server.hop_count < req.server.max_hops and
            req.server.original_source != self.cluster.local_url):
            asyncio.create_task(self._broadcast_new_function(
                fun_name,
                req.server.locs,
                hop_count=req.server.hop_count + 1,
                max_hops=req.server.max_hops,
                announcement_id=req.server.announcement_id,
                original_source=req.server.original_source
            ))
```

### 5. Type-Safe Cluster State Management

**Location**: `mpreg/datastructures/cluster_types.py`

The cluster state was completely redesigned with proper type safety:

```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class ClusterState:
    """Complete cluster state management with proper typing."""
    # Flattened configuration (no nested config object)
    cluster_id: ClusterID
    advertised_urls: AdvertisedURLs
    local_url: NodeURL
    dead_peer_timeout_seconds: float = 30.0

    # Type-safe registries
    function_registry: ClusterFunctionRegistry = field(default_factory=ClusterFunctionRegistry)
    announcement_tracker: FederatedAnnouncementTracker = field(default_factory=FederatedAnnouncementTracker)

    # Runtime state
    waiting_for: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict, init=False)
    answers: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict, init=False)
    peer_connections: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict, init=False)
    peers_info: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict, init=False)

@dataclass(slots=True)
class FederatedAnnouncementTracker:
    """Manages tracking of federated announcements for deduplication."""
    seen_announcements: AnnouncementRegistry = field(default_factory=dict)
    ttl_seconds: DurationSeconds = field(default=300.0)  # 5 minutes

    def has_seen(self, announcement_id: AnnouncementID) -> bool:
        return announcement_id in self.seen_announcements

    def mark_seen(self, announcement_id: AnnouncementID, timestamp: Timestamp) -> None:
        new_registry = dict(self.seen_announcements)
        new_registry[announcement_id] = timestamp
        self.seen_announcements = new_registry
```

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Multi-Hop Propagation

- Function announcements propagate through up to **3 hops** by default
- Each hop increments the `hop_count` field
- Messages dropped when `hop_count >= max_hops`
- Type-safe hop count validation with `FederatedPropagationInfo.can_forward`

### ✅ Deduplication with Type Safety

- Each announcement gets a unique `AnnouncementID` (type alias)
- `FederatedAnnouncementTracker` manages seen announcements with proper typing
- TTL-based cleanup of old announcement records
- Type-safe registry operations with `AnnouncementRegistry`

### ✅ Original Source Preservation

- The `original_source` field preserves the actual function host using `NodeURL` type
- Federated announcements route to original source, not forwarding peer
- Critical for accurate function execution routing
- `ServerCapabilities` dataclass encapsulates server function information

### ✅ Advanced Loop Prevention

- **CRITICAL FIX**: Modified `should_process()` method to distinguish initial vs. forwarded announcements
- Initial announcements (hop_count=0) bypass loop detection to allow servers to broadcast their own functions
- Forwarded announcements include full loop detection to prevent cycles
- Type-safe loop detection with `FederatedRPCAnnouncement.is_loop_back()`

### ✅ Complete Type Safety Transformation

- Replaced primitive types with semantic type aliases (`ClusterID`, `NodeURL`, `FunctionName`, etc.)
- All federated components use strongly-typed dataclasses with `slots=True` for performance
- MyPy-validated type safety throughout the federated system
- Backwards compatibility maintained with type conversion utilities

### ✅ Backwards Compatibility

- All new fields have sensible defaults
- Existing MPREG functionality unaffected
- Non-federated deployments work unchanged
- Legacy primitive type support via conversion utilities

## Integration Points with Existing MPREG Systems

### 1. **Function Registration** (`register_command`)

- Location: `mpreg/server.py:1760`
- Automatically triggers `_broadcast_new_function` for new functions
- Integrates with type-safe `ClusterState.function_registry`
- Uses `ClusterFunctionRegistry` for proper resource-to-server mapping

### 2. **Function Discovery** (`server_for`)

- Location: `mpreg/server.py:430`
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Now correctly finds servers with the requested function
- Previously selected random servers; now uses `ClusterState.get_servers_for_function()`
- Type-safe function resolution with `FunctionName` and `NodeURL` types

### 3. **Type-Safe Cluster State Access**

- **ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE**: Flattened `ClusterState` structure
- Removed nested `config` object access pattern
- Direct access to `cluster_id`, `local_url`, `function_registry`, `announcement_tracker`
- All cluster operations now use typed interfaces

### 4. **Message Serialization**

- Uses existing `JsonSerializer` from MPREG core
- Enhanced with type-safe field validation
- Backwards compatible with existing message formats

### 5. **Connection Management**

- Uses existing `peer_connections` for message forwarding
- Leverages established WebSocket connection handling
- Type-safe connection state tracking

### 6. **Gossip Protocol Integration**

- Federated announcements work alongside existing gossip
- Both systems share the same connection infrastructure
- Enhanced with proper announcement deduplication

## Testing Infrastructure

Comprehensive test suites validate the federated RPC implementation:

### 1. **Integration Tests** (`tests/test_integration_examples.py`)

- **CRITICAL TEST FIXED**: `test_resource_based_routing` now passes
- Multi-server function discovery and execution
- Cross-server dependency resolution
- Resource-based routing validation
- Type-safe client-server interaction

```python
# Example: Resource-based routing test that now works
async def test_resource_based_routing(cluster_2_servers, client_factory):
    server1, server2 = cluster_2_servers

    # Register functions on different servers
    server1.register_command("process_a", process_model_a, ["model-a"])
    server2.register_command("process_b", process_model_b, ["model-b"])

    # Functions propagate via federated announcements
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

    client = await client_factory(server1.settings.port)

    # Calls are routed to correct servers based on resources
    result_a = await client.call("process_a", "test", locs=frozenset(["model-a"]))
    result_b = await client.call("process_b", "test", locs=frozenset(["model-b"]))

    assert result_a == "model-a processed: test"
    assert result_b == "model-b processed: test"
```
