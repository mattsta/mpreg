#### 3. Security Properties

- **Missing:** Authentication, authorization, data integrity properties
- **Impact:** Security guarantees not systematically verified

## Test Infrastructure Quality Assessment

### ✅ **Excellent Infrastructure Components**

#### 1. AsyncTestContext Framework

```python
@dataclass
class AsyncTestContext:
    servers: list[MPREGServer] = field(default_factory=list)
    clients: list[MPREGClientAPI] = field(default_factory=list)
    tasks: list[asyncio.Task] = field(default_factory=list)
```

- **Quality:** Excellent resource management and cleanup
- **Pattern:** Proper async/await patterns throughout
- **Reliability:** Prevents test interference and resource leaks

#### 2. Dynamic Port Allocation

```python
def server_cluster_ports(request) -> list[int]:
    port_range = get_port_range(request.node.name)
    return list(range(port_range.start, port_range.start + 10))
```
